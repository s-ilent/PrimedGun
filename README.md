# PrimedGun

PrimedGun is a Dolphin OpenXR-side VR enhancement app for Metroid Prime.

## Build

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Nobbie248/PrimedGun.git
cd PrimedGun
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Runtime Files

For distribution/share, the useful files are:

- `PrimedGun.exe`
- `PrimedGun_DolphinHook.dll`
- `assets/`
- `core/`
- `D3DCompiler_47.dll`
- `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`
- `libstdc++-6.dll`
- `libwinpthread-1.dll`
- `primedgun_settings.ini`
- `README.md`

## Features

- Full directional movement.
- Offhand controller yaw controls directional strafing.
- Visor hand gesture input: the app reads the control stick as visor D-pad input when the controller is near your head.
- Improved gun-based lock/scan targeting.
- VR arm cannon tracking through Dolphin-side OpenXR.
- One-click height calibration.
- Position, rotation, scale calibration.
- In-headset settings menu.
- Automatic Dolphin OpenXR controller binding setup.

## Usage

1. Launch `PrimedGun.exe`.
2. Load Metroid Prime GCN NTSC Rev 0 (`GM8E01`) in Dolphin.
3. PrimedGun detects the game when GM8E01 is loaded into memory.
4. When in game click the right stick to set height.

## VR Settings Menu

- Click the left thumbstick to open or close the in-headset settings menu.
- The menu is attached to the left controller.
- Use A to change the pointed-at setting.
- Use `Save Settings` to write `primedgun_settings.ini`.

## Notes

- Settings are saved to `primedgun_settings.ini`.
- Dolphin controller bindings are applied automatically on startup.
- The app reads controller tracking from Dolphin-side OpenXR and writes the cannon transform into Dolphin memory.
- PrimedGun should be running before Metroid Prime is loaded so the Dolphin-side hook is ready as soon as GM8E01 memory appears.
- For the best experience, try not to turn your body around. You can move in the game like this, but functionality is not ideal.
